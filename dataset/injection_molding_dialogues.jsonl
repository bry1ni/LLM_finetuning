{"dialogue_id": 100, "participants": ["Tooling Designer", "Process Engineer", "Quality Control Expert"], "conversation": [{"speaker": "Tooling Designer", "text": "We recently switched to using PBT instead of ABS for a housing component. The shrinkage behavior was quite different\u2014had to compensate with a 0.8% dimensional adjustment."}, {"speaker": "Process Engineer", "text": "Interesting. Did you notice any differences in flow behavior? PBT tends to have higher viscosity, especially with 30% glass fill."}, {"speaker": "Quality Control Expert", "text": "Right, and that affects fill pressure. We had to bump up injection pressure by 10% and tweak the V/P switchover point."}, {"speaker": "Tooling Designer", "text": "Did that solve your warpage issues? We usually see warpage around thick-to-thin transitions, especially with semi-crystalline materials like PBT."}, {"speaker": "Process Engineer", "text": "Mostly. But we also redesigned the gate location to avoid jetting and ensure uniform flow front. That helped a lot with part symmetry."}, {"speaker": "Quality Control Expert", "text": "Gating changes make a huge difference. We\u2019ve been using sequential valve gating for multi-cavity tools.
